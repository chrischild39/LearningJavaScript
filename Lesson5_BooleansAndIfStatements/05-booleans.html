  // The comparison operators are as follows (they have lower order of operations than math):
  // > - greater than
  // < - less than
  // >= - greater than or equal to
  // <= - less than or equal to
  // == - equal to (attempts to convert values to the same type prior to comparison)
  // === - equal to (does not attempt to convert values to the same type prior to comparison)
  // != - not equal to (attempts to convert values to the same type prior to comparison)
  // !== - not equal to (does not attempt to convert values to the same type prior to comparison)

  // The logical operators are as follows (they have lower order of operations than comparison operators):
  // && - AND operator
  // || - OR operator
  // ! - NOT operator

  // Javascript supports truthy and falsy values
  // Falsey Values - false, 0, '', NaN, undefined, null
  // Truthy Values - all non falsey values are truthy values
